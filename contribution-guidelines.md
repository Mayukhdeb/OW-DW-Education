### Contribution Guidelines 

The following contributor guidelines set the standard for proposed contributions to the OW/DW Educational curriculum.

1) All contributions are made under the [CC-BY-4.0 license](https://github.com/devoworm/OW-DW-Education/blob/master/CC-BY-SA-4.0%20License.md).  

2) All contributors must meet with a project administrator before being given "collaborator" status on the Github repo.

3) Contributions can be proposed for any course content, but they must be reviewed by the project administrator before incorporation into specific lesson plans.

4) Project administrators reserve the right to propose editorial changes to curriculum as proposed. Changes might include exclusion or merger of topics/lesson materials, reorganization of content structure, creation of new modules or courses from said contribution.

The OpenWorm Foundation has two levels of contributor: General Contributor and [Senior Contributor](http://openworm.org/people). While anyone can be a general contributor, senior contributor candidates are nominated and voted on by existing senior contributors. As project leaders and intellectual leaders within the organization, only senior contributors are eligible to be administrators.
