### Contribution Guidelines 

The following contributor guidelines set the standard for proposed contributions to the OW/DW Educational curriculum.

1) All contributions are made under the [CC-BY-4.0 license](https://github.com/devoworm/OW-DW-Education/blob/master/CC-BY-SA-4.0%20License.md).  

2) All contributors must meet with a project administrator before being given "collaborator" status on the Github repo.

3) Contributions can be proposed for any course content, but they must be reviewed by the project administrator before incorporation into specific lesson plans.

4) Project administrators reserve the right to propose editorial changes to curriculum as proposed. Changes might include exclusion or merger of topics/lesson materials, reorganization of content structure, creation of new modules or courses from said contribution.

The OpenWorm Foundation has two levels of contributor: General Contributor and [Senior Contributor](http://openworm.org/people). While anyone can be a general contributor, senior contributor candidates are nominated and voted on by existing senior contributors. As project leaders and intellectual leaders within the organization, only senior contributors are eligible to be administrators.   

### How to make content suggestions

1) modify files directly and make a pull request in the respective repository. Moderators will have the right to reject or modify any contributions.

2) use [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) to annotate web-based content.

* make notes on the website pages themselves or make notes about how to utilize content for a specific workshop idea.

* these notes remain public and collaborative in the hypothes.is browser extension.
   
3) create a web note (using tools such as a [Chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/web%20notes?hl=en) or [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027048/microsoft-edge-add-notes-to-sites)). Please adhere to the following steps:   

* make your markups using your chosen app.

* when finished, save as an image file (.jpg format).  

* upload and push the image to the [Web Notes](https://github.com/devoworm/OW-DW-Education/tree/master/Web%20Notes) repository.
