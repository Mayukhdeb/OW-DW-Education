Developmental attractors are a measure of spatial [self-organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organization) in the embryo. In general, [attractors](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Attractor) are defined as the convergence of a dynamicl system over developmental time. Unlike algorithmic convergence, [attractor basins](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Basin_of_attraction) can be highly complex and hard to interpret. Attractors are created by real phenomena such as [genetic regulatory networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_regulatory_network), [morphogenetic gradients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2773637/), and developmental trajectories.
