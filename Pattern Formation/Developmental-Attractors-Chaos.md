### Developmental Attractors

Developmental attractors are a measure of spatial [self-organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organization) in the embryo. In general, [attractors](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Attractor) are defined as the convergence of a dynamical system over developmental time. Unlike algorithmic convergence, [attractor basins](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Basin_of_attraction) can be highly complex and hard to interpret. A basin of attraction characterizes the mean behavior of a given system over time in a multi-dimensional phase space. The trajectory of a system's state over time forms an attractor, which is characterized by its oscillatory nature and shape. A chaotic system can operate at states very far from equilibrium, but eventually settle down to the mean behavior (or equilibrium state). Attractors are created by real phenomena such as [genetic regulatory networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_regulatory_network), [morphogenetic gradients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2773637/), and developmental trajectories.

Attractors are part of a larger class of [chaotic dynamical behaviors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory). Chaos is a [deterministic process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_system_(philosophy)) that characterizes the measure of state space behavior over time. Chaotic systems also possess unique nonlinear behaviors such as [sensitivity to initial condition](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/SensitivityToInitialConditionsInChaos/), [periodic orbits](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Periodic_orbit), and [recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion).

The Lorenz attractor is used here to demonstrate the form of the [iconic "strange attractor"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos:_Making_a_New_Science), but other types of attractors (in terms of form) are likely to be more applicable to developmental phenomena. In the Lorenz example, the graphical pattern is derived from coupled differential equations that describe a two-dimensional flow of uniform depth (&#919;) with temperature differences (&#916;T), a specific gravity (&#103;), thermal diffusivity (&#922;), and kinematic viscosity (&#957;). The key elements of a developmental-specific attractor then are the following components: a model system, a [differential equation](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Difference-DifferentialEquation.html) or [recursion equation](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RecurrenceEquation.html) formalization, and a set of parameters that either fluctuate or remain constant over time. 

Another issue more specific to development is the ability to model regulatory mechanisms such as feedback or self-organization. Figure 4 shows how this occurs at the molecular level. Taken together with Figure 1, a spatiotemporal mode of developmental chaos can be worked out.

### Mathematical Chaos

Developmental attractors are the result of a phenomenon called _chaos_. The mathematical version of chaos has a number of specific properties, including but not limited to:

* unstable behavior far from equilibrium.

* sensitivity to initial condition.

* nonlinear feedback that can amplify small changes.

* described using geometrical mathematics.
