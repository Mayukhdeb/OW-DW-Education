## OpenWorm/DevoWorm Curriculum Roadmap

The activities of this initiative cover three long-term goals: 1) uniquely positioning our organization in terms of online education, 2) integration with our other educational assets to serve organizational needs, and 2) to serve as a conduit for strengthening community ties.

__1) Online education.__ One goal of OW/DW Education is to offer both learning and pedagogical opportunities around topical themes and project content. We have the ability to establish a niche in the online education environment by offering unique topics while also providing a unique perspective on these topics. 

__2) Organizational integration.__ A second goal of OW/DW Education is to integrate more formal educational opportunities with our existing educational and scientific assets. In particular, we would like to integrate our digital badge content with our simulation environments and open datasets to provide a more reflective experience for current and potential contributors alike.

__3) Community-building.__ A third goal of OW/DW Education is as a community-building function. Our curriculum will serve as an educational catalyst (e.g. what contributors need to know or that they are missing from conventional materials) and as a contribution catalyst (what is minimal amount of knowledge needed to make advanced contributions).
